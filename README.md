# ML-methods-for-binary-classification
Comparison between different machine learning methods for binary classification 

1. Download all the files and place them in the same directory. 

2a. Run the Binary_classification_methods.py file to test the following methods:
    DecisionTreeClassifier
    Rule-Based Classifier
    K-Neighbours Classifier
    Naive-Bayes
    Suport Vector Machines
    Adaboost (Ensemble methods)
    
2b. Run the Neural_network.py file to test the DNN model.

If you want to test your own dataset, place the .csv or .data file in the same directory as the codes, and update the dataset names in the python stripts.
